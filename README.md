# MAST
Modular Analyzer of the System and the network data Traffic

MAST is an anomaly based intrusion detection system, able to find all the suspicious activities related to the network data traffic and the file system, relying on the data captured during the profiling phase, in which it collects all those activities usually performed on the system. Indeed, MAST should be installed and activated when the operating system is absolutely not compromised by any kind of malware. MAST is a modular project, that means it can be expanded in future with additional modules. Currently available modules are:
  - Traffic Analyzer: report anomalies when a suspicious amount of network data traffic it's happening on any of the network interfaces;
  - Ransomware Catcher: can figure out when a ransomware is running on the system, sending a notification to the user for warning him of the problem.
